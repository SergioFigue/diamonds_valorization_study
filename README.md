# The M2 Project
Project M2 is an analytic and visual study of a dataset containing thousands of **diamonds**.

## The Worthy Purpose

The purpose of this study is to try and find the influence of different attributes and measures of a diamond in said diamond price. Through a series of calculations and operations, we will clean irrelevant data while learning the basics of the distribution while representing in charts and boxes relevant information. 
The result is a helpful visualization where you could compare performance of each parameter related to the price.  

## The tour guide

Project M2 is based on a public dataset (find it in [Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds](https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds))). The study is divided in two parts, an analytical study made on Jupyter and a visualization made with Tableu. What you need:
**Jupyter**___

**Tableau** ___


**What you should know**: ___The 4Cs of Diamonds: carat, color, cut and clarityCalculations of a diamond: % Table and % DepthMeasurements: x, y and z  


## The main ideas  

Through the process, we have learnt that there is a strong relationship between carat and price. And between carat and size. However, there a break point in the almost lineal progression.

Apparently, price varies along the remaining Cs and their own set of values.
